# py-widget

A simple library to create UI elements in python, based on PyGame. This library implements various UI elements like buttons and sliders.

It's meant to be very easy to use, requiring very little technical skills. So, should you use it? Probably not.. Even simple visualizations takes many milliseconds to render, it's a bit buggy, and i make no promises to avoid breaking changes.

## Usage

To use the library, simply do ``` pip install git+https://github.com/IslandRock1/py-widget.git@v0.1.0-alpha```.
Then in your code the library can be imported like this: ````import pg_widgets as pw````. Examples can be found in the tests directory.

## Showcase
